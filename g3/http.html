<h1>how to setup gitolite to use smart http mode</h1>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: "smart http" refers to the feature that came with git 1.6.6, late
2009 or so.  The base documentation for this is <code>man git-http-backend</code>.  Do
<strong>NOT</strong> read <code>Documentation/howto/setup-git-server-over-http.txt</code> and think
that is the same or even relevant -- that is from 2006 and is quite different
(and arguably obsolete).</p>

<h2>WARNINGS and important notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Please read <a href="auth.html">authentication versus authorisation</a> first, and make
sure you understand what is gitolite's responsibility and what isn't.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'gitolite' command (for example, 'gitolite compile', 'gitolite
query-rc', and so on) <em>can</em> be run on the server, but it's not
straightforward.  Assuming you installed using the exact same values as in
this document:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a shell by using, say, <code>su -s /bin/bash - apache</code></li>
<li>run <code>export HOME=$HOME/gitolite-home</code></li>
<li>run <code>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin</code></li>
</ul>

<p><p>Now you can run <code>gitolite &lt;subcommand&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>I have tested only on stock Fedora 16; YDMV</p></li>
<li><p>As before, I have not tried making repos available to both ssh <em>and</em> http
mode clients but it ought to work.  If you managed it, I'd appreciate a
doc patch describing how you did it.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>additional requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>requires <code>GIT_PROJECT_ROOT</code> (see "man git-http-backend" for what this is)
set explicitly (i.e., it is no longer optional).  Please set it to some
place outside apache's <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>assumptions:</h2>

<ul>
<li>apache 2.x and git installed.</li>
<li>httpd runs under the "apache" userid; adjust instructions below if not.</li>
<li>similarly for "/var/www" and other file names/locations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>instructions</h2>

<p>The detailed instructions I used to have in g2 have now been replaced by a
script called <code>t/smart-http.root-setup</code>.  <strong>Do NOT run this script as is -- it
is actually meant for my testing setup and deletes stuff</strong>.  However, it does
provide an excellent (and working!) narration of what you need to do to
install gitolite in smart http mode.</p>

<p>Make a copy of the script, go through it carefully, (possibly removing lines
that delete files etc.), change values per your system, and only then run it.</p>

<h2>usage</h2>

<p>Git URLs look like <code>http://user:password@server/git/reponame.git</code>.</p>

<p>The custom commands, like "info", "expand" should be handled as follows.  The
command name will come just after the <code>/git/</code>, followed by a <code>?</code>, followed by
the arguments, with <code>+</code> representing a space.  Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code># ssh git@server info
curl http://user:password@server/git/info
# ssh git@server info repopatt
curl http://user:password@server/git/info?repopatt
# ssh git@server info repopatt user1 user2
curl http://user:password@server/git/info?repopatt+user1+user2
</code></pre>

<p>With a few nice shell aliases, you won't even notice the horrible convolutions
here ;-)  See t/smart-http for a couple of useful ones.</p>
